## Setup

Setting up the project for local development depends on the platform you intend to develop on. We have set up guides for:

- [macOS – Laravel Valet (preferred)](./docs/setup/macOS-valet.md)
- [macOS – Laravel Sail](./docs/setup/macOS-sail.md)
- [Windows 10 – Laravel Sail](./docs/setup/windows.md)

Before continuing, please read the appropriate setup guide for your development environment.
